<h1>Welcome!</h1>
	       
<p>As you probably know by now, this is my personal blog, since you did, in fact, willing click on the button labelled "Blog" at the top of the screen, just a moment ago. It is currently in its infantile stages, but I hope that after some undisclosed period of time, it will blossom into something wonderful to look back on.</p>

<p>...Or something something so haneous that I want to tear my own eyes out at the very thought of its very existance. I mean, after all, I do hate writing. And if everything goes as expected, you probably will too after reading what I have to say.</p>

<p>...but I digress.</p>

<p>I'll primarily use this blog for things like my personal projects such as my light up keyboard, my trip down under, and whatever else I deem worth to type with my precious fingers. After all, carpol tunnel is the real evil here, and I'm not distancing myself from it by click-clackin' away on this here blog.</p>
