<p>So, rather than recount every meager detail of my trip as it happens, I decided to continue down the slightly less egotistical path and recount cultural, visual, and other discrepencies between America and Australia. Generally, these would include things that no one (possibly from either side) would have previously heard about, things that are probably stereotypical but are indeed true, and things that are stereotypes but are actually quite false.</p>

<p>I figured some topics would be the following...</p>

<ul>
	<li>Food &amp; Drink</li>
	<li>Sport</li>
	<li>Slang</li>
	<li>Uni/College</li>
	<li>More to Come...</li>
	<li>Probably...</li>
	<li>Maybe...</li>
</ul>
